		<h1>Kristoff</h1>

		<p>The concept of DDR requires its players to be somewhat physically fit to be able to enjoy the game.  People who have gout, epilepsy, and body odor are strongly discouraged to play DDR because it may endanger the player or other people near the player.  Physical disfigurations, however, do not need to be total hindrances to players from becoming good DDR players.</p>

		<p>Kristoff Oskar Davies was born on January 2, 1987, with one leg shorter than the other.  This physical aberration, however, wasn’t detected until his age was promoted into double-digit numerals.  It didn’t seem to affect his day-to-day functioning, though, so he didn’t think much of it until his first encounter with DDR.</p>

		<p>Kristoff studied in Pruost Science High School Valodok and lived in its dormitory during the years he has studied there.  During his second year in high school one of the students boarding in the same dormitory Kristoff was boarding in brought his PlayStation to the dormitory.  One of the games that became popular for PlayStation back then was DDR.  During those times, players who owned DDR played DDR either with a soft dance pad (which barely gave the players full satisfaction of the game) or with the controller that came with the PlayStation (which defeats the purpose of playing DDR in the first place.)  Kristoff’s first encounter with DDR wasn’t pleasant because of his right leg being half an inch shorter than his left leg.  Because of this slight disfiguration, Kristoff had trouble keeping his balance.  Normally issues with balance could easily be offset by holding what DDR players call “the bar” that was installed on the pad itself behind the player.  The bar, however, was only available for use on DDR arcade cabinets.  Some YouTube videos show DDR and Pump It Up (or PIU as it is going to be referred to from now on) players who play DDR or PIU using soft dance pads using the back of chairs as a substitute for the bar, but this improvisation wasn’t well-known during Kristoff’s first encounter with DDR.  With Kristoff’s first encounter with DDR being a rousing failure he paid scant attention to the development of DDR until college.</p>

		<p>Kristoff graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of the Pruostine Valodok, and it was also when he was studying to get his undergraduate degree his interest in rhythm games (the genre many people consider DDR to be a part of) developed.  During his years in college he has tried other rhythm games released (although no longer supported) by Konami, the developer of DDR.  For four years he diverted his energy for playing DDR to energy for playing Dance Maniax and Para Para Paradise.  Kristoff initially didn’t have much interest in playing Dance Maniax.  Kristoff only tried Dance Maniax as a dare from his peers.  However, if it weren’t for that dare, his spectrum of interest for rhythm games wouldn’t have been broadened and he probably wouldn’t have returned to playing DDR in 2009.</p>

		<p>During his Dance Maniax and Para Para Paradise phase Kristoff didn’t play much DDR.  It was only in late January 2009 when he ran into an old acquaintance of his in Kova city playing DDR he started to play DDR again.  From then on Kristoff became a frequent customer of Wondergate’s Lucky Coms and, with the passage of time, became a rather proficient DDR player.</p>

		<p>While Kristoff undoubtedly became better at DDR, he did not let DDR take control of his life.  He showed resilience from being addicted to DDR.  Deep down, he knew that DDR is but one aspect of his life and there are other aspects in his life worth paying more attention to.  He now lives in a condominium in Mangasova City and has a new career in Oberthur Technologies.</p>
