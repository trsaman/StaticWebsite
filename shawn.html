		<h1>Shawn</h1>

		<p>There is a long-standing stereotype of video game players that video game players don’t have any social life, let alone love life.  Although the advent of online gaming has proven this stereotype to be false for computer and console game players, arcade game players are still victims of this stereotype.  Shawn, fortunately, doesn’t uphold this stereotype.</p>

		<p>Prior to Shawn’s first encounter with DDR one could easily mistake Shawn Benjamin Quentin as a statistic for the stereotype society has upheld towards video game players.  Much like any boy who owned a PlayStation and/or a computer during the early 2000s, Shawn had a passion for playing role-playing games (RPGs) like Diablo II and the Final Fantasy series and first-person shooter (FPS) games like Half-Life and Quake III Arena.  Some video game players, however, have a saturation point at which point they notice that casting Frozen Orb over and over again doesn’t give them the satisfaction it once gave them when their Sorceress reached level 30.  For Shawn, DDR’s gameplay was a welcome change.  Unlike Diablo II, DDR didn’t require its players to gain virtual experience to become stronger in a virtual world.  Shawn had so much interest in DDR that he had his soft dance pad customized so that it wouldn’t move around as much when used to play PARANOiA KCET (clean mix).</p>

		<p>As DDR released new versions, its gameplay changed as well.  DDR has evolved from a combo-based music game to a timing-based music game.  Earlier versions of DDR simply required its players to finish a song with a high number of steps correctly stomped in succession.  Timing didn’t matter as much as it did when Konami released DDR 5thMIX.  Versions beyond DDR 5thMIX required players to step on the arrows at exactly the right time so that they would be able to get the highest score possible.  Knowledge of this key concept of later versions of DDR helped Shawn get more value for what he paid for the tokens he used to play DDR and become one of the best DDR players in Serd.</p>

		<p>Shawn carried his interest in DDR into college and beyond.  Unbeknownst to him it would also be DDR that would bring him a girlfriend.  When Shawn transferred to Fernan Boris College, he stopped playing DDR in Jubilopolis and started playing either in Retroscore or Comiscore.  However, one serendipitous day Shawn decided to pay Jubilopolis a visit.  Upon arriving at the game center where DDR was, Shawn saw a petite, plucky girl who was about to play.  Shawn mustered up the courage to ask permission from the girl if he could join her.  Suraya, the girl, allowed Shawn to join her.  After playing, Shawn escorted Suraya to her ride home right before getting her mobile number.  Every night after that day Shawn would call Suraya just to check up on her and talk and after two months, Suraya became Shawn’s girlfriend.</p>

		<p>Shawn’s passion for DDR remained unwavering despite the slew of rhythm games such as PIU and In the Groove (or ITG as it is going to be referred to from now on) other developers have released.  Shawn attributes two things to the development of his skills in DDR:  perseverance and communication.  As it was mentioned before, Shawn’s interest in DDR evolved as the years passed.  The mindset he had of getting better at DDR helped him actually get better at DDR.  As for communication, Shawn wouldn’t have gotten the point system of later versions of DDR if he didn’t ask those who knew (and were) better than him.</p>

		<p>Shawn is now a registered nurse and is preparing for training for critical care nursing.</p>
