		<p>Aspiring to be good at something isn’t hard to do.  A child who watches Apollo 13 can aspire to become an astronaut some day.  Stephen Hawking could have watched Michael Flatley one day and could have aspired to become a legendary tap dancer.  Anyone who has seen the inside of Bill Gates’ house can aspire to become insanely rich one day.  Sadly, movies like The Karate Kid, Ice Princess, and The Forbidden Kingdom distort the actual amount of time it takes for something to be mastered at the degree shown at the end of the movie by the movies’ protagonists.  According to Malcolm Gladwell, author of the book Outliers, it takes a person 10,000 hours to master something he or she is trying to be good at.  A staggering amount, yes, but there may be some truth to that.  It took Michael Flatley six years of dancing lessons before he won the All-Ireland World Championship for Irish dance.  If Gladwell’s assumption is to be followed, it would mean that Michael Flatley had to practice dancing for four-and-a-half hours every day from 1969 to 1975 to win the mentioned award.  Nothing short of a genetic defect or divine intervention is going to sharpen any skill instantly, and one of those skills include being a proficient DanceDanceRevolution (or DDR as it is going to be referred to from now on) player</p>

		<p>DDR revolutionized the notion of video games in the late 1990s.  Most of the video games that existed before the release of DDR exercised only the players’ hands and/or arms, which prompted the medical community to coin the term Nintendinitis, a form of repetitive strain injury that affects a person’s hands and/or arms.  DDR, however, exercised not only the players’ hands and arms but also the players’ legs and lungs, which is why playing DDR takes skill that may never be acquired from playing a number of years’ worth of Ms. Pacman.</p>

		<p>Over time DDR has caught the attention of many arcade players.  Some who have tried it went on to finish songs with increasingly maddening step patterns released with every new version of DDR.  Most, however, try the game once and then give up because it’s too hard but still watch prodigies of DDR in awe.  This collection tells the stories of the humble beginnings of some of the best (and on-the-way-to-being-the-best) DDR players in the Pruostine.</p>

		<p>The people presented in this collection do not represent every DDR player who has strived to become good at the game.  They, however, have one thing in common with every other DDR player who studies the steps of Pluto Relinquish in the hopes of achieving what DDR players call a PFC (Perfect Full Combo):  they practiced.  A lot.  One may see himself or herself as one of the people mentioned in this collection.  May this collection serve as an inspiration not only for the reader to strive to be good in DDR, but in every aspect of his or her life as well.</p>
