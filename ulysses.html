		<h1>Ulysses</h1>

		<p>If one was to watch YouTube videos of DDR players tackling songs with insane step patterns, one would think that DDR requires gargantuan amounts of leg strength and lung power.  Konami is aware of the physiological requirements of some step patterns and the possible prospect of people using DDR as a fitness device, so Konami included a Workout Mode that would enable its players to play a certain amount of DDR that would let them know how many calories its players have burned.  Ulysses was aware of this feature and decided to use it to his advantage.</p>

		<p>Ever since he was born on September 1, 1988, Ulysses Bernhaardt has always been on the large side.  His genes may be partially at fault, but prior to his engagement to DDR, he led a rather laid-back life with not much physical activity.  He would rather stay home and play with computer games or read whatever was worth reading than go outside and frolic with the other children in his neighborhood.  Things started to change, however, when his mother came back from Shen Ra on November 1999.</p>

		<p>As the PlayStation matured, its price went down and the freebies that came along with each purchase of the console increased.  By the turn of the century, DDR became such a huge hit that when one purchased a new PlayStation he or she got a soft dance pad and DDR 2ndMIX along with the console.  Ulysses’s mother struck up that kind of a deal while she was on a business trip in Shen Ra.  When Ulysses’s mother finally got home, Ulysses played DDR and was hooked on the game.  That is, until his PlayStation’s motherboard gave out on July 2000.  While Ulysses’s interest in DDR died temporarily, his affinity towards rhythm games just started to develop.  In fact, it was another rhythm game that ushered back in Ulysses’s interest in DDR.</p>

		<p>Early in 2008 Ulysses was already a prominent figure in an online gaming community.  The game, which was called O2Jam, was about to have a major event sponsored by its distributor in the Pruostine.  As part of the need to have a group identity, the members of the O2Jam community decided to have customized shirts done for them at Shirtopolos in Terratown.  Unfortunately for Ulysses, Shirtopolos’s largest shirt size was XXL.  The shirt fit him, but he could hardly breathe in it.  Fortunately for Ulysses, he had two weeks to lose whatever bulk in his midsection was restraining his respiratory system.  For two weeks, he played an hour of DDRMAX on his PlayStation2 using the dreaded soft dance pad.  During those two weeks, Ulysses began to feel that he may have a future with DDR (and actually was able to fit in the shirt he had to wear for the event), and on January 2009, he began to build that future.</p>

		<p>“Misery loves company.”  Or so the saying goes.  Misery, however, is not the only abstract concept that loves company.  Passion also loves company.  In the middle of January 2009, Ulysses began to feel that he was stuck in a rut while playing DDR.  He felt that he could no longer improve his skills in DDR.  However, one fateful night Ulysses ran into an old acquaintance of his when he was still a computer science major.  Ulysses was playing in Wondergate’s Lucky Coms, and when he finished a stage, he turned around and saw a familiar face.  Kristoff, who Ulysses knew when he was still a computer science major, happened to pass by Wondergate on his way home from Fortunetworks.  After a conversation that involved some catching up, Ulysses and Kristoff decided to play DDR at least once a week just for fun.</p>

		<p>Ulysses, unlike the four players mentioned before him, was attracted to men, particularly to those who happened to be good at DDR.  Shawn is one of the reasons why Ulysses decided to keep on playing DDR.  Not only was Shawn good at DDR, but he was also quite a looker when Ulysses first got a glimpse of him.  Oddly enough, it was Kristoff who had the guts to approach Shawn and introduce him to Ulysses.  A few months later, Shawn introduced Ulysses to Harold, to whom Ulysses was insanely attracted to until now.  Ulysses now tells people that he has three reasons for playing DDR:  health, Shawn, and Harold.</p>

		<p>Many DDR players claim that they play DDR for health reasons.  Such a claim is not unheard of and is actually valid.  Ulysses now plays DDR not only because he wants to but also because he needs to.  Numerous incidences of gout attacks have shaken Ulysses to lose weight so that the gout attacks would come less frequently, if not at all.  He now tries to balance DDR with the requirements he has to submit to get a degree in library and information science from the University of the Pruostine Valodok.</p>
