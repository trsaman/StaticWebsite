		<h1>Harold and Horace</h1>

		<p>Siblings who share the same passion for something are not uncommon.  Despite the fighting and rivalry, at some point during their lives living together they’re bound to find something they both are interested in.  Harold and Horace not only found DDR as common ground they could tread on but also rhythm games that have released since DDR.</p>

		<p>Harold Desmond Hull, who was born on May 6, was born three years after his brother Horace Hull, who was born on November 16, 1987.  As the only sons of their father’s second wife, Ursula Paizao, Harold and Horace have had their fair share of brotherly fights which ended with either Harold crushed under Horace’s sheer mass or Horace drowning in his own tears.  Despite their fights, however, they also shared a passion for rhythm games and especially the songs in those rhythm games.</p>

		<p>Soft dance pads are, as it has been mentioned, not the optimum controllers to play DDR with.  Soft dance pads tend to move around a lot when used on a hard surface and have a tendency to be torn apart when there’s too much traction between the pad and the surface it is played on.  Harold and Horace knew the downsides of playing DDR with a soft dance pad all too well, so in 1999 they started playing DDR with the PlayStation DualShock Analog Controller.  While for some people it would seem that the brothers have defeated the purpose of playing DDR, Harold and Horace didn’t mind playing DDR with DualScock Analog Controllers because it wasn’t the exercise they were after; it was the songs.  DDR introduced Harold and Horace to the world of song genres like happy hardcore and techno, songs that are highly unlikely to be played on the radio.  However, their interest in DDR slowly faded after a few years but was revived in December 2003 when they first played DDR the way it was supposed to be played:  using one’s legs and lungs.</p>

		<p>Playing DDR on an arcade cabinet doesn’t provide the exact same gaming experience as playing DDR with a gaming console.  While DDR cabinets are manufactured more or less with the same physical features, gaming consoles provide a wildly varying gaming experience for DDR players.  One glaring difference between playing DDR on an arcade cabinet and playing DDR with a gaming console is the dance pad each device uses.  More often than not, DDR players who play using a PlayStation, PlayStation2, Xbox, or Wii use a soft dance pad which can be quite a hindrance to achieving a high score, which, after DDR 4thMIX, was achieved by stepping precisely to the rhythm of the song rather than stepping on the arrows correctly in succession.  On the other hand, DDR players who play on a DDR arcade cabinet get to play on sturdier dance pads without having to worry where they and the dance pad would end up after playing DEAD END.</p>

		<p>When Harold and Horace played DDR again in December 2003, the version of DDR they were playing (DDR EXTREME) has already adopted the timing-based scoring system, thus making playing DDR on an arcade cabinet the lesser of two evils (the other one being playing DDR with a gaming console on a soft dance pad) to be able to step precisely to the rhythm of the song.  It was also that month when Harold and Horace decided to go their separate ways when it came to rhythm games.  From then on, Horace’s interest in rhythm games was mainly directed towards its song list while Harold’s interest in rhythm games was directed mainly towards its gameplay.  In the years that followed, Harold and Horace have encountered a myriad of rhythm games.  Both brothers upheld their interests.  By 2009, Horace has over one terabyte’s worth of songs in his collection and Harold has acquired a load of skills needed to play almost every conceivable rhythm game in the world.</p>

		<p>Much like Kristoff, Harold and Horace didn’t let rhythm games take over their lives.  With the brothers’ mother already living in the Stuoburg, Horace keeps his household intact.  Harold, on the other hand, is pursuing to get a degree in chemistry at the Polytechnic University of the Pruostine Kocovac.</p>
